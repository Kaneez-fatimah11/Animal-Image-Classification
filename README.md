# Animal-Image-Classification
In this project, I build a model to identity the category of animals.
I used the dataset from Kaggle-"Animals-10".  This dataset consists of animal images belonging to 10 categories: dog, cat, horse, spyder, butterfly, chicken, sheep, cow, squirrel, elephant. In this model tensorflow, numpy, pandas, os,cv2, sklearn are used.
